#### Time:
Tuesday / Thursday at 13:00 - 14:30

#### location: 
Seminar Room 1-3 (SR1-3), Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Noethnitzer Str 38, Dresden 01187
start: October, 10th
## Outline:

Introduction to modern quantum many-body dynamics, covering
foundations (quantum chaos and quench dynamics) and advanced topics
(many-body localization, driving and Floquet engineering, time
crystals, quantum circuits). A small supervised research component,
with projects including very recent developments, is an important
part of the course.
